I'm originally a physicist, with a Master's in cognitive science, now a third year computer science PhD student in [Inria Nancy](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-nancy-grand-est) in the [Multispeech team](https://www.inria.fr/en/multispeech), supervised by [Antoine Deleforge](https://members.loria.fr/ADeleforge/) and [Emmanuel Vincent](https://members.loria.fr/EVincent/). 
My research is focused on audio, in particular I have been working on deep-learning-based **audio source separation** and **speech enhancement** for a few years.


Since my very first lines of code, I've been loving open-source! :heart:
My largest contribution is this field is the co-creation of [Asteroid](https://github.com/asteroid-team/asteroid), a PyTorch library to make source separation and speech enhancement simple. You can check my other projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mpariente) and on [Asteroid's organization](https://github.com/asteroid-team)

title: Hi, I'm Manu 
---

I'm originally a physicist, with a Master's in cognitive science, now a third year computer science PhD student in [Inria Nancy](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-nancy-grand-est) in the [Multispeech team](https://www.inria.fr/en/multispeech), supervised by [Antoine Deleforge](https://members.loria.fr/ADeleforge/) and [Emmanuel Vincent](https://members.loria.fr/EVincent/). 
My research is focused on audio, in particular I have been working on deep-learning-based **audio source separation** and **speech enhancement** for a few years.


Since my very first lines of code, I've been loving open-source! :heart:
My largest contribution is this field is the co-creation of [Asteroid](https://github.com/asteroid-team/asteroid), a PyTorch library to make source separation and speech enhancement simple. You can check my other projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mpariente) and on [Asteroid's organization](https://github.com/asteroid-team)

**Updates:**
- *November 2020*: Our team (Samuele Cornell, Michel Olvera, Giovanni Pepe, EmanuelePrincipi, Leonardo Gabrielli, Stefano Squartini and me) won the jury's price for the most innovative approach for DCASE Task 4.
- *October 2020*: Our team (Samuele Cornell, Fabian-Robert St√∂ter, Michel Olvera, Jonas Haag and me) **won the [PyTorch Summer Hackathon 2020](https://pytorch2020.devpost.com/)** with our [Asteroid/DeMask submission](https://devpost.com/software/asteroid-the-pytorch-based-source-separation-toolkit).
- *October 2019*: We are releasing [Asteroid](https://github.com/asteroid-team/asteroid), a PyTorch toolkit for researchers in speech separation and enhancement. Hop on and help us! 
- *July 2019*: I'm participating to the [JSALT 2019](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/19-workshop/) summer school and workshop where I'll be working on robust multichannel speech separation and speech enhancement.
- *September 2018*: I'll be leaving the ENS and joining the [Multispeech team](https://www.inria.fr/en/multispeech)) at [Inria Nancy](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-nancy-grand-est) to start a PhD on generative models of speech, with an emphasis of phase modeling!
